# Process Synchronization Simulation in C : 
# This program demonstrates advanced inter-process communication (IPC) and synchronization using POSIX semaphores and shared memory.
# It creates 5 child processes that concurrently access a critical section (a shared global sum). 
# Semaphores are implemented to ensure mutual exclusion, allowing each process to safely add its number (1-5) to the sum, correctly reaching a total of 15. 
# The parent process waits for all children to terminate and then handles the full cleanup of all shared resources.

# Core Concepts: C, Linux, Process Management, Semaphores, Shared Memory, IPC.

# Mini Operating System (OS) Simulation in C :

# A C-based simulation of a basic operating system kernel, managed via a command-line menu.
# This project simulates core OS functionalities, including: Process Management: Dynamically creating and managing processes.
# CPU Scheduling: A complete implementation of the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm, including a simulation of I/O blocking requests.
# Resource Management: Modules for basic memory tracking, a simple file system, and I/O management.

# Core Concepts: C, Linux, Operating System Design, Process Scheduling (Round Robin), Memory Management.
